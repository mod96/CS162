# 1. Scheduling Concept

Scheduling is deciding which threads are given access to resources from moment to moment. We mainly think in terms of CPU time, but could also think about access to resources like network BW or disk access.

Program typically uses the CPU for some period of time, then does I/O, then uses CPU again. Most of them has short burst duration. We need to decide which job to give to the CPU, while we could force executing thread to give up CPU for timeslicing.

## 1.1. requirements

### 1.1.1. Minimize Response Time

Have to minimize elapsed time to do an operation, so that user can see the result of committed job.

### 1.1.2. Maximize Throughput

Have to maximize operations per second. (trade-off with minimize response time)

### 1.1.3. Fairness

Have to share CPU among users in some equitable way.


## 1.2. FCFS (First Come, First Served)

Suppose process P1 with burst time 24, P2 with 3, P3 with 3.

</p>

This seems simple, but has critical disadvantage. Short process can stuck behind long process (`Convoy effect`)

## 1.3. RR

## 1.4. Priority Scheduling

Strict Priority Scheduling -> Dynamic priorities

### 1.4.1. What if we knew the future?: SRTF

SJF, SRTF

## 1.5. Multi-Level Feedback Scheduling

Approximation of SRTF

## 1.6. Lottery Scheduling


# 2. Real-world Scheduling

## 2.1. Linux O(1) Scheduler 

-> no one use this now(hard to understand why something done that way)

## 2.2. Realtime Scheduling

## 2.3. Starvation

## 2.4. Fairness

### 2.4.1. Stride Scheduling

### 2.4.2. CFS


# 3. Deadlock

4 requirements

Graph examples

## 3.1. detection algorithm

## 3.2. Preventing Deadlock

prevention - remove 1 of requirements

### 3.2.1. Banker's Algorithm
