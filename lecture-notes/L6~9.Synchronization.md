## 1.1. How process/thread executes

Process/Thread, switches periodically(depending on scheduler's rule), or if it calls I/O request, syscall, it will sent back to waiting queue.

PCBs move from queue to queue. Rather than ready queue, there are lots of different device/signal/condition queues like USB Unit 0 queue, USB Unit 1 queue, ..., Disk Unit 0 queue, ..., Ethernet 0 queue, ..., etc. Each queue can have a different scheduler policy.

Conceptually, the scheduling loop of the operating system looks as follows:
```
Loop {
    RunThread();
    ChooseNextThread();
    SaveStateOfCPU(curTCB);
    LoadStateOfCPU(newTCB);
} // power shutdown, kernel panic would exit this loop
```

How do I run a thread?
- Load its state (registers, PC, stack pointer) into CPU
- Load environment (virtual memory space, etc)
- Jump to the PC

### 1.1.1. How does the dispatcher get control back?
#### Internal events: thread returns control voluntarily

- Blocking on I/O
  - The act of requesting I/O implicitly yields the CPU
- Waiting on a 'signal' from other thread
  - Thread asks to wait and thus yields the CPU
- Thread executes a `yield()`
  - Thread volunteers to give up CPU
```
computePI() {
    while(TRUE) {
        ComputeNextDigit(); // it's not a good example since computing pi goes slower when digit goes far.
        yield(); // gives control back to kernel
    }
}
```

Let's dive to `yield`.

Blue is user code, red is kernel level. (we're using one-to-one threading model)

If Thread S starts first, it's stack start with A(). Then it invokes B(), and then yield(). yield() calls run_new_thread() of kernel(this point control got to the kernel), and kerne calls switch(). Once same operation happens for Thread T, Thread S's switch() returns, ..., yield() returns. And again, Thread S calls yield(), ...

What's happening in `switch()`? pseudo-code might like:
```
Switch(tCur,tNew) {
    /* Unload old thread */
    TCB[tCur].regs.r7 = CPU.r7;
    …
    TCB[tCur].regs.r0 = CPU.r0;
    TCB[tCur].regs.sp = CPU.sp;
    TCB[tCur].regs.retpc = CPU.retpc; /*return addr*/
    /* Load and execute new thread */
    CPU.r7 = TCB[tNew].regs.r7;
    …
    CPU.r0 = TCB[tNew].regs.r0;
    CPU.sp = TCB[tNew].regs.sp;
    CPU.retpc = TCB[tNew].regs.retpc;
    return; /* Return to CPU.retpc */
}
```

Isn't it expensive in context switching? => Yes, but our one-to-one model is fast enough.

- Frequency of context switch: 10-100ms
- Switching between processes: 3-4 μsec.
- Switching between threads: 100 ns

#### External events: thread gets preempted

What happens if thread never does any I/O, never waits, and never yields control?

=> Answer: utilize external events
- Interrupts: signals from hardware or software that stop the running code and jump to kernel
- Timer: like an alarm clock that goes off every some milliseconds

- Interrupts invoked with interrupt lines from devices. 
- Interrupt controller chooses interrupt request to honor
  - Interrupt identity specified with ID line
  - Mask enables/disables interrupts
  - Priority encoder picks highest enabled interrupt
  - Software Interrupt Set/Cleared by Software
- CPU can disable all interrupts with internal flag
- Non-Maskable Interrupt line (NMI) can’t be disabled
